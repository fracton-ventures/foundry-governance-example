Template for Forge based on [femplate](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate) and [forge-template](https://github.com/FrankieIsLost/forge-template) with ERC-20 example tests.

## Getting Started

Click `use this template` on [Github](https://github.com/soliditylabs/forge-erc20-template) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or run (also works for existing projects):

```bash
forge init --template https://github.com/soliditylabs/forge-erc20-template
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge install
```

## Blueprint

â””â”€ MyERC20 â€” "A Minimal ERC-20 Contract"
```

## Development

**Building**

```bash
forge build
```

**Testing**

```bash
forge test -vvvvv
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the values.

To deploy the ERC-20 to Rinkeby:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-to-rinkeby.sh
```

To verify the ERC-20 on Rinkeby:

```bash

```

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:

```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/MyERC20.sol`](./src/MyERC20.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/MyERC20.t.sol`](./src/tests/MyERC20.t.sol).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
